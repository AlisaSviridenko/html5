       <div class="description"> The old town of Bari lies on a peninsula between the old and new harbors, and the industrial zone extends inland.

There are few tourists, with the exception of Orthodox pilgrims to the relics of St. Nicholas the Wonderworker, which were secretly taken from Myra Lycia in 1087 and have since been kept in the crypt of the Basilica of St. Nicholas specially built to house them (founded in 1087).

Since 1915 (approximate date), the Orthodox Church of St. Nicholas the Wonderworker has been operating in Bari, designed in the Old Novgorod spirit by Alexei Shchusev. Services in the church are conducted by a Russian priest of the Moscow Patriarchate. In 2001, a statue of St. Nicholas by Vyacheslav Klykov was installed next to the temple.

Other significant buildings in the city include the collegiate church of St. Sabinus, an example of Romanesque architecture (1170–1178, restored in the 1950s), Friedrich Hohenstaufen's seaside castle (Castello Svevo, 13th century) and the ancient Petruzzelli Theater, a renovated building which opened in 2009.

The second city theater is named after the Barian Niccolo Piccini. Bari is called the “Gateway of the East,” but a special step towards church unity was made in the 60s of the 20th century: after the Second Vatican Council, the then Archbishop of Bari, Mons.
Nicodemo opened the tomb of St. Nicholas the Wonderworker to the Orthodox, along with a small chapel and iconostasis.</div>

<p id="history" style="display:none">During World War II, British divisions captured the city.
       On the night of December 2, 1943, a tragic event occurred - Bari, the only European city, was subjected to a chemical attack. The events of that night were kept secret until 1967, when writer Glenn B. Infield revealed the story in his book Disaster at Bari.
       Once again the city suffered a disaster on April 9, 1945, when the Liberty Charles Henderson, carrying a thousand tons of aircraft bombs, exploded in the port. The harbor was destroyed, and human casualties amounted to 360 thousand.
